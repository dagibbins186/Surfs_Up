# Overview
This project used SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. SQLite facilitated a quick prototype. SQLAlchemy supported the queries in SQLlite. Flask, a web framework, accessed Python code to share and visualize the analysis. The goal of this project was to test an idea for a surf and shake shop. To increase the odds of investor backing, this analysis explored weather patterns in Oahu. Analysis verified the viability of this location for the business.
# Results
Analysis examined Oahu's preciptation over the course of one year. On average, Oahu received .177 inches of rain. At maximum, 6 inches of rain fell on the island. Preciptitation should not deter sales of a surf and shake shop.

9 stations exist on Oahu. Analysis evaluated the most active station. This location's temperature averaged 72 degrees. Warm weather should improve the odds of ice cream and water-activity sales.
